#Compare Files

### Introduction

This file can be used to campe two files.

In my everyday life I used it when I wanted to compare
the files of an old version of a software with the new
files.

It was very helpful and I hope it will be useful for you, too

### Usage

Just download this folder and load the files you want to compare in it, set the amount of files in the for-loop and that's it
